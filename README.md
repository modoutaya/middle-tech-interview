# Count Primes

Given an integer `n`, return _the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than_ `n`.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
The algorithm works by elimination: it consists of removing from a table of integers from 2 to N all the multiples of a number (other than itself).
By eliminating all these multiples, in the end, only the integers that are not multiples of any number except 1 and themselves will remain ‚Äî these are the prime numbers.
We start by crossing out the multiples of 2, then the remaining multiples of 3, then the remaining multiples of 5, and so on, each time crossing out all the multiples of the smallest remaining integer.
We can stop when the square of the smallest remaining integer is greater than the largest remaining integer, because in that case, all non-primes have already been crossed out earlier.
At the end of the process, all the integers that haven‚Äôt been crossed out are the prime numbers less than N.

### **Example 1:**
    Input: n = 10
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
    
### **Example 2:**
    Input: n = 0
    Output: 0
    
### **Example 3:**
    Input: n = 1
    Output: 0

# Team Management API (PHP ‚Äì Clean Archi)

## üéØ Objective

Build a minimal backend service in **PHP** to manage **teams and their members**, following **Clean Architecture** principles.  
This exercise is designed to evaluate your ability to:
- Model a simple business domain
- Apply clean separation of concerns
- Write clear, testable, and maintainable PHP code

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

- **Language**: PHP ‚â• 8.0
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture  
- **Storage**: In-memory only (arrays or singleton objects)
- **Frameworks**: None (no Symfony, Laravel, etc.)
- **Testing**: Optional (bonus points for testing one use case)

---

## üß± Features to Implement

### 1. Create a Team  
**POST** `/teams`  
**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Team Rocket"
}

Response:
{
  "id": "team_abc123",
  "name": "Team Rocket"
}
```

### 2. Add a Member to a Team
**POST** `/teams/{teamId}/members`  
**Request:**
```json
{
  "memberId": "user-123",
  "email": "jessie@example.com"
}

Response:
{
  "memberId": "user-123",
  "email": "jessie@example.com"
}
```


### 3. Add a Member to a Team
**GET** `/teams/{teamId}/members`  
Response:
```json
[
  {
    "memberId": "user-123",
    "email": "jessie@example.com"
  },
  {
    "memberId": "user-456",
    "email": "james@example.com"
  }
]
```

## üìè Business Rules

- A team **must have a name** (non-empty).
- A team ID is **auto-generated** (e.g., using `uniqid()` or UUID).
- A team can have multiple members.
- A member must have:
  - a **memberId** (string)
  - a **valid email address** (basic format check)
- A given `memberId` **cannot be added more than once** to the same team.
- The same `memberId` **can exist in multiple teams**.
- The same email can be reused in different teams.
- If the team does not exist (when adding or listing members), the system must return a **404 ‚Äì Team Not Found** error.
- No update or delete operation is required for teams or members.
